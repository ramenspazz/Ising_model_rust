# Ising model: rust
The spin glass ising model programmed in rust

# Running
The easiest way to run this is to run `cargo run --release`, then running `python -O plot.py` when you want to visualize the output files' data.

# Install RUST
Please follow the instructions here on the RUST-lang website https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.

# Testing
Run `cargo test` to test if the program is working properly on your system. This test takes the data from the `cv4_test.dat` file and computes the energy and magnitization of the
predefined system and compares it to precomputed known values.

# Report
The file `Ising_Report.pdf` contains the results and technical explination of the significance of the results from the program.
